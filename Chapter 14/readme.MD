   page and a category page
2. Enable CSS and JS minification and bundling for your local instance. Remember that some of
   these features only work in production mode.
3. Install and configure Magepack on your local AC/Magento Open Source instance. Make it work
   for the home page, the category page, the product page, and the checkout process
4. Implement at least one improvement for each CWV metric. Suggestions include optimizing
   large images, deferring non-critical JS, or ensuring text remains visible during webfont load.
